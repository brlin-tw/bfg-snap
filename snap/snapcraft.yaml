title: BFG Repo-Cleaner
summary: Removes large or troublesome blobs like git-filter-branch does, but faster
description: |
  The BFG is a simpler, faster alternative to [`git-filter-branch`][1] for cleansing bad data out of your Git repository history:

  * Removing **Crazy Big Files**
  * Removing **Passwords**, **Credentials** & other **Private data**

  The `git-filter-branch` command is enormously powerful and can do things that the BFG can't - but the BFG is _much_ better for the tasks above, because:

  * [Faster][2] : **10 - 720x** faster
  * [Simpler][3] : The BFG isn't particularily clever, but _is_ focused on making the above tasks easy
  * Beautiful : If you need to, you can use the beautiful Scala language to customise the BFG. Which has got to be better than Bash scripting at least some of the time.

  **Snap-specific notes**

  You can adjust JVM memory allocation via adding the Java -Xmx arguments to the `bfg` command-line, example:

      bfg -Xmx2048m ...

  No other JVM parameters are supported as of now.
